# Maze-Solver

- Java application GUI to solve maze.


## Technologies Used

- Java Swing, AWT
- DFS, BFS Algorithm, graphs
- Apache NetBeans IDE


## Features

- Made the application GUI using Java Swing and AWT.
- Implemented DFS Algorithm to find the path from starting to end point.
- Implemented BFS Algorithm to find the shortest path from starting to end point.
- User can change the start and end/target point between which path needs to be found, by a left/right click of the mouse!
- Calculates the path count (no of boxes that need to be travelled from start to reach till the end)

## Further Exploration
- Probably turn this into a game, where user can try and find the path, before showing it to them.
